## Overview
### Description
This application's finality is personal scheduling. Users can launch and join meetings with friends and family. The app finds users the best hour to join meetings based on their availability settings and that of other users.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Utility
- **Mobile:** Portability
- **Story:** Encouraging real-life social interactions and meetings among friends and family.
- **Market:** All android users could use this app, especially not to fill their professional calendars with their casual appointments.
- **Habit:** A utility app. To be used when needed. It can be addictive in the sense that users will be curious to see what events their friends are joining ( assuming the timeline activity will display that information/ similar to VENMO's timeline).
- **Scope:** Feasible depending on the complexity of finding the time that works for all 'attendees'.
